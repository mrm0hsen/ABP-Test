2024-01-16 15:22:17.606 +03:30 [WRN] Savepoints are disabled because Multiple Active Result Sets (MARS) is enabled. If 'SaveChanges' fails, then the transaction cannot be automatically rolled back to a known clean state. Instead, the transaction should be rolled back by the application before retrying 'SaveChanges'. See https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2149338 for more information and examples. To identify the code which triggers this warning, call 'ConfigureWarnings(w => w.Throw(SqlServerEventId.SavepointsDisabledBecauseOfMARS))'.
